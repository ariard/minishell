Freelib

Freelib is a simple C library implementing some features a standard library should have.

I wrote the main part for my first project at 42 school and now add features when I need them on news ones.

It respects a lot of 42's standard and programming style and don't rely on third-party libraries.

Features

-dlist
-int
-mem
-print
-stack
-string
-algo
